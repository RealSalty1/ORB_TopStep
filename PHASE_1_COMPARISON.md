## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### 1. **Partial Exits Capping Winners** 🔴
- **Max Win dropped from +1.5R to +0.5R**
- Partial exits are locking in profits too early
- 50% exit at +0.5R prevents runners from hitting +1.5R target
- **Impact**: Lost ~67% of potential winners' upside

### 2. **Wider Stops Working Against Us** 🔴
- Stops widened from 1.0x to 1.3x (30% wider)
- **But**: Avg loser got worse (-0.018R → -0.02R)
- **Hypothesis**: Wider stops let losing trades sit longer, accumulating more bars
- Possible issue: Breakeven trigger at +0.3R might not be aggressive enough

### 3. **Win Rate Improved (+46%)** ✅
- Went from 3.44% to 5.04%
- Confirms entry filters and time restrictions are helping
- More trades surviving to breakeven (breakeven logic working)

### 4. **Fewer Salvage Exits** ⚠️
- Dropped from 150 to 108 salvages (-28%)
- Salvages had 94% WR in baseline
- Losing valuable profit protection mechanism

### 5. **Average Winner Shrunk** 🔴
- From +0.596R to +0.38R (-36%)
- Confirms partial exits are the culprit
- We're giving up too much upside for "safety"

## 💡 **Diagnosis**

The **partial exit strategy** is the main problem:

1. **Baseline Strategy**:
   - Let winners run to full +1.5R target
   - High max win potential
   - Lower win rate (3.4%) but big wins when they hit

2. **Phase 1 Strategy**:
   - 50% exit at +0.5R (locks in gains)
   - 25% exit at +1.0R
   - Only 25% runs to target
   - **Result**: Max win capped at +0.5R weighted avg
   - Higher win rate (5%) but smaller average wins

**The math doesn't work:**
- Baseline: 3.4% WR × 0.596R avg win = 0.020R contribution from winners
- Phase 1: 5.0% WR × 0.38R avg win = 0.019R contribution from winners
- **We're winning more often but making less money**

## 🎯 **Recommended Fixes (Phase 1.1)**

### **Priority 1: Adjust Partial Exit Levels** 🔧

**Current (broken):**
- 50% at +0.5R
- 25% at +1.0R  
- 25% to +1.5R target

**Proposed Fix A (More Aggressive):**
- 25% at +0.75R (half the position)
- 25% at +1.25R (half remaining)
- 50% to +1.5R target (let half run!)

**Expected Impact:**
- Max win potential: 50% × 1.5R + 25% × 1.25R + 25% × 0.75R = 1.25R
- Better balance between safety and upside

### **Priority 2: Tighten Breakeven Trigger** 🔧

**Current:**
- Breakeven at +0.3R MFE

**Proposed:**
- Breakeven at +0.2R MFE (earlier protection)
- Add "soft breakeven" at entry + 1 tick (reduce scratch trades)

**Expected Impact:**
- More trades protected from full stop loss
- Reduce avg MAE

### **Priority 3: Add Trailing Stop After First Partial** 🔧

**Current:**
- Fixed stops through all partial levels

**Proposed:**
- After first partial hit (+0.75R), trail stop to +0.5R (lock in profit)
- Prevents give-back on remaining position

**Expected Impact:**
- Reduce salvage events
- Lock in gains more aggressively

## 📈 **Expected Phase 1.1 Results**

If we implement fixes above:

| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 1.1 Target | Rationale |
|--------|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Win Rate** | 5.0% | 6-7% | Better trailing logic |
| **Avg Winner** | +0.38R | +0.75R | Let more run to higher targets |
| **Max Win** | +0.50R | +1.25R | 50% position can hit full target |
| **Total Return** | -8.29R | +15-20R | Higher avg winners |
| **Expectancy** | -0.001R | +0.004R | Back to positive |

## 🧪 **Testing Strategy**

1. ✅ **Phase 1 Complete** - Wider stops, breakeven, partials, time filters
2. 🔄 **Phase 1.1 Next** - Adjust partial levels, tighten breakeven
3. ⏳ **Phase 2 After** - Entry filters, context exclusion fix, enable PB2/PB3

---

## 💭 **Key Learnings**

1. **Partial exits are a double-edged sword** - They increase win rate but cap profit potential
2. **The "let winners run" principle still applies** - Can't scale out too aggressively
3. **Win rate ≠ profitability** - 5% WR with 0.38R avg is worse than 3.4% WR with 0.596R avg
4. **Need to balance protection vs potential** - Current setup over-protects

---

**Status:** Phase 1 underperformed, moving to Phase 1.1 adjustments  
**Next Action:** Modify partial exit levels and retest  
**ETA:** 15-20 minutes for implementation + backtest
