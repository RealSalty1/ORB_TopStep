## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. One-Trick Pony
- **98% of trades** from VWAP Magnet playbook
- Opening Drive Reversal: 1 trade
- Momentum Continuation: 0 trades
- Initial Balance Fade: 0 trades

### 2. Over-Trading Same Move
- Entered SHORT 10 times as market fell
- No correlation filter
- No "already exposed" check

### 3. No Daily Limits
- Kept trading after +20R day
- No stop-loss if day goes bad
- Can give back all profits

### 4. Salvage Too Aggressive
- 60% of trades salvaged
- Exits at 31 bars if < 0.2R
- May be exiting future winners

### 5. Chart Data Broken
- Index shows 1970 instead of 2025
- Causes duplicate candlesticks
- **Fixed in next run**

### Priority 2 (This Week)
5. Loosen ODR and MC entry constraints
6. Add time-of-day filters (avoid midday chop)
7. Make salvage regime-aware

### Priority 3 (Next Week)
9. Position sizing multipliers (regime, time, streak)
10. Drawdown protection
11. Volume profile analysis
