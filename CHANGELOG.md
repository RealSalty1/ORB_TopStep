- Three configuration profiles:
  - default.yaml (balanced)
  - aggressive.yaml (more signals, higher targets)
  - conservative.yaml (strict filters, early exits)
- Example backtest script (`examples/example_backtest.py`)
- Quick start guide (QUICKSTART.md)

#### Added - Testing
- Unit tests:
  - Configuration validation
  - Indicator calculations (ATR)
  - OR building and validity
  - Factor signals
- Integration test for full backtest pipeline
- pytest configuration with coverage reporting

#### Added - Documentation
- README.md with project overview
- QUICKSTART.md with step-by-step guide
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md with architecture details
- Google-style docstrings on all public functions
- Inline comments for complex logic

### Technical Details

**Architecture Pattern**: Layered modular design  
**Code Style**: Black formatting, Ruff linting  
**Type Safety**: Full type hints, mypy compatible  
**Testing**: pytest with hypothesis for property tests  
**Packaging**: Poetry with lock file  
**Python Version**: 3.11+  

**Dependencies**:
- Data: pandas, numpy, pyarrow
- Validation: pydantic
- Performance: numba (JIT compilation)
- Visualization: plotly, jinja2
- Data sources: yfinance, requests
- Logging: loguru
- Optimization: optuna (ready for integration)

**Lines of Code**: ~5,000+ (excluding tests)  
**Test Coverage**: Core modules covered  
**Configuration Parameters**: 50+ tunable parameters  

### Design Philosophy

1. **Modularity**: Clean separation of concerns
2. **Testability**: Dependency injection, pure functions
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add factors, data sources, stop modes
4. **Transparency**: Full logging, factor attribution, audit trail
5. **Reproducibility**: Deterministic backtests, config versioning
6. **Performance**: Numba optimization where needed
7. **Type Safety**: Pydantic validation, type hints everywhere
8. **Documentation**: Comprehensive docstrings and guides

### Known Limitations

- Yahoo Finance intraday data limited to ~30 days
- No real volume profile (quartile approximation used)
- Swing stop mode framework present but not fully implemented
- No order flow factors (awaiting data source)
- No live trading integration (backtest only)
- No parameter optimization UI (Optuna integration pending)

### Future Roadmap

**Phase 1.1** (Near-term enhancements):
- Swing stop pivot detection implementation
- Optuna parameter optimization integration
- Walk-forward testing framework
- Additional synthetic scenarios

**Phase 1.5** (Data upgrades):
- Real volume profile integration
- Order flow delta factors
- News event filtering
- Multi-instrument correlation analysis

**Phase 2.0** (Production preparation):
- Paid futures feed integration (IQFeed/Rithmic)
- Live paper trading mode
- Broker API connections
- Slippage and fill modeling

**Phase 3.0** (Dashboard):
- React/TypeScript frontend
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Interactive parameter explorer
- Trade drill-down interface
