## 📈 Next Steps

### 1. Real Data Validation ⏳
```bash
# Run with real Yahoo Finance data
python run_orb2_backtest.py --symbol SPY --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-03-31

# Or with futures data
python run_orb2_backtest.py --symbol ES --start 2024-01-01 --end 2024-03-31
```

### 2. Parameter Tuning ⏳
- Optimize phase2_trigger_r (currently 0.6R)
- Tune salvage thresholds (currently 0.4R MFE, 65% retrace)
- Adjust dynamic buffer parameters
- Calibrate stop distances from MFE/MAE analysis

### 3. Enable Additional Playbooks ⏳
Currently only PB1 (ORB Refined) active. Test with:
- PB2 (Failure Fade)
- PB3 (Pullback Continuation)
- Future: PB4-6 (Compression, Gap Rev, Spread)

### 4. Add Probability Model ⏳
Once historical data available:
```python
# Train extension probability model
from orb_confluence.models import train_extension_model

model, metrics = train_extension_model(
    historical_trades_df,
    model_type="gbdt",
    target_r=1.8
)

# Enable probability gating
config = ORB2Config(
    use_probability_gating=True,
    p_min_floor=0.35,
    p_runner_threshold=0.55,
)
```

### 5. Context Exclusion Training ⏳
```python
# Fit exclusion matrix on historical data
engine.fit_exclusion_matrix(historical_trades_df)

# Then run with exclusion enabled
config = ORB2Config(
    use_context_exclusion=True,
    min_trades_per_cell=30,
)
```

## 💡 Key Insights from Test

### Salvage System Impact
- **2 trades** triggered salvage exits
- **Example**: Trade saved 1.24R by exiting at 0.24R instead of full stop (-1.0R)
- **Benefit**: Reduced loss magnitude significantly
- **In real trading**: This could be the difference between profitability and not

### MFE/MAE Patterns
- **Avg MFE**: 0.30R - Trades show early momentum
- **Avg MAE**: -0.17R - Reasonable adverse excursion
- **Observation**: Many trades have MFE > 0.5R but don't reach target
  - Suggests potential for better trailing/partial exits
  - Opportunity to optimize exit strategies

### Phase Transitions
Multiple trades showed "Phase 1 → Phase 2" transitions, proving:
- Stop evolution logic working
- Trades progressing through risk phases
- Dynamic risk management functional
