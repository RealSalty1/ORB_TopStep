## 🎯 Integration Ready

All playbooks are ready for:

### ✅ Registry Management
```python
from orb_confluence.strategy.playbook_base import PlaybookRegistry
from orb_confluence.strategy.playbooks import *

registry = PlaybookRegistry()
registry.register(IBFadePlaybook())
registry.register(VWAPMagnetPlaybook())
registry.register(MomentumContinuationPlaybook())
registry.register(OpeningDriveReversalPlaybook())

# Get by regime
range_playbooks = registry.get_playbooks_for_regime("RANGE")
# Returns: [IB Fade, VWAP Magnet, Opening Drive]
```

### ✅ Signal Generation
```python
for playbook in registry.get_enabled():
    signal = playbook.check_entry(
        bars=historical_bars,
        current_bar=current_bar,
        regime=current_regime,
        features=current_features,
        open_positions=open_positions,
    )
    
    if signal:
        signals.append(signal)
```

### ✅ Position Management
```python
# Update stops
new_stop = playbook.update_stops(
    position, bars, current_bar, mfe, mae
)

# Check salvage
should_exit = playbook.check_salvage(
    position, bars, current_bar, mfe, mae, bars_in_trade
)
```

### ✅ Performance Tracking
```python
# After trade closes
playbook.update_stats(r_multiple, bars_in_trade)

# Get summary
print(playbook.get_summary())
```
