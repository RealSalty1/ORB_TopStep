# Project Progress Report - October 6, 2025

## 📊 Project Overview

### Project Name
**ORB (Opening Range Breakout) Confluence Strategy - Multi-Factor Intraday Trading System**

### Objective
Develop a modular, testable Python research platform for an intraday Opening Range Breakout (ORB) strategy with multi-factor confluence. The platform enables systematic backtesting, analysis, and visualization of ORB breakout trades using real market data.

### Development Track
**Free/Current Track** - Using open-source data providers:
- Yahoo Finance (primary)
- Real-time ES futures and SPY data
- 1-minute intraday bars
- No cost limitations

---

## 🎯 Trading Strategy - Opening Range Breakout (ORB)

### Strategy Concept

The Opening Range Breakout strategy is based on the principle that the first 15 minutes of trading (the "Opening Range" or OR) establishes key support and resistance levels. Breakouts above or below this range often lead to sustained directional moves.

#### Core Components

1. **Opening Range (OR) Definition**
   - **Duration**: First 15 minutes of market open (9:30 AM - 9:45 AM ET)
   - **OR High**: Highest price during the opening range
   - **OR Low**: Lowest price during the opening range
   - **OR Width**: Distance between OR High and OR Low

2. **Breakout Criteria**
   - **Long Signal**: Price breaks above OR High + buffer
   - **Short Signal**: Price breaks below OR Low - buffer
   - **Buffer**: 0.20 - 2.0 points (configurable, currently 0.20 for tight breakouts)

---

## 📈 How a Trade is Executed

### Phase 1: Pre-Market Setup

**Market Open (9:30 AM ET)**
- System begins tracking price action
- Records every 1-minute OHLCV bar
- No trades are placed during this period

**Opening Range Formation (9:30 AM - 9:45 AM)**
- Accumulate 15 minutes of data
- Calculate:
  - OR High = Maximum of all 15-minute bars' highs
  - OR Low = Minimum of all 15-minute bars' lows
  - OR Mid = (OR High + OR Low) / 2
  - OR Width = OR High - OR Low

**Validation**
- Ensure continuous minute coverage (no gaps)
- Check OR width is within acceptable range
- Confirm OHLC data integrity

### Phase 2: Trade Signal Generation

**Post-OR Monitoring (After 9:45 AM)**

System monitors price in real-time for breakouts:

#### Long Breakout Signal
```
IF price_high > (OR_High + buffer):
    → LONG SIGNAL TRIGGERED
    Entry Price = OR_High + buffer
```

#### Short Breakout Signal
```
IF price_low < (OR_Low - buffer):
    → SHORT SIGNAL TRIGGERED
    Entry Price = OR_Low - buffer
```

**Signal Requirements**:
- Must occur after OR is finalized (post 9:45 AM)
- One signal per direction per day (no multiple longs/shorts)
- Breakout must be confirmed on bar close (not intrabar)

### Phase 3: Entry Execution

**Immediate Actions Upon Signal**:

1. **Record Entry Details**
   - Entry timestamp
   - Entry price (OR High/Low + buffer)
   - Direction (long or short)
   - Trade ID (unique identifier)

2. **Calculate Stop Loss**
   
   **For LONG trades**:
   ```
   Stop Distance = max(OR_Width * 1.2, 2.0 points)
   Stop Price = Entry Price - Stop Distance
   ```
   
   **For SHORT trades**:
   ```
   Stop Distance = max(OR_Width * 1.2, 2.0 points)
   Stop Price = Entry Price + Stop Distance
   ```
   
   The stop is placed beyond the opposite side of the OR to give the trade room.

3. **Calculate Take Profit Targets**
   
   Based on R-multiples (where 1R = Stop Distance):
   
   **For LONG trades**:
   ```
   Target 1 (T1) = Entry Price + (1.5 * Stop Distance)  [1.5R]
   Target 2 (T2) = Entry Price + (2.0 * Stop Distance)  [2.0R]
   Target 3 (T3) = Entry Price + (3.0 * Stop Distance)  [3.0R]
   ```
   
   **For SHORT trades**:
   ```
   Target 1 (T1) = Entry Price - (1.5 * Stop Distance)  [1.5R]
   Target 2 (T2) = Entry Price - (2.0 * Stop Distance)  [2.0R]
   Target 3 (T3) = Entry Price - (3.0 * Stop Distance)  [3.0R]
   ```

### Phase 4: Trade Management

**Continuous Monitoring** (Bar-by-Bar):

For each new 1-minute bar after entry:

1. **Check Stop Loss Hit**
   ```
   LONG:  IF bar_low <= stop_price → EXIT at stop_price, Reason: "stop"
   SHORT: IF bar_high >= stop_price → EXIT at stop_price, Reason: "stop"
   ```

2. **Check Target Hit**
   ```
   LONG:  IF bar_high >= target_price → EXIT at target_price, Reason: "target_N"
   SHORT: IF bar_low <= target_price → EXIT at target_price, Reason: "target_N"
   ```

3. **End of Day Management**
   ```
   IF time >= 4:00 PM ET AND position still open:
       EXIT at current_close_price, Reason: "eod"
   ```

**Priority Rules** (when multiple conditions hit same bar):
1. Stop Loss takes precedence (risk management first)
2. Then targets (profit-taking)
3. Worst-case execution assumed (conservative approach)

### Phase 5: Exit & Recording

**Exit Execution**:

When exit condition is met:

1. **Record Exit Details**
   - Exit timestamp
   - Exit price (stop/target/close)
   - Exit reason (stop, target_1, target_2, target_3, eod)

2. **Calculate Performance Metrics**
   ```
   P&L = (Exit Price - Entry Price) * Direction
   where Direction = +1 for long, -1 for short
   
   Realized R = P&L / Stop Distance
   ```

3. **Update Trade Records**
   - Save complete trade data
   - Update equity curve
   - Record bar data window (±30 min around trade)

## 🚧 Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **Simplified Factor Logic**
   - Multi-factor confluence not fully integrated
   - Currently only using basic breakout detection
   - ADX, VWAP, Profile factors need full implementation

2. **Data Constraints**
   - Yahoo Finance: 7-day limit on 1-minute data
   - No real-time streaming (delayed by 15-20 minutes)
   - Limited to free data sources

3. **Execution Assumptions**
   - Assumes fills at trigger prices
   - No slippage modeling
   - No commission/fee consideration

4. **Sample Size**
   - 11 trades is statistically small
   - Need 100+ trades for robust conclusions
   - Limited to 1-week backtest period

### Planned Improvements

1. **Factor Integration**
   - Complete multi-factor confluence implementation
   - Proper score weighting
   - Adaptive factor selection

2. **Data Enhancement**
   - Multi-day data aggregation
   - Symbol rotation for 7-day limit
   - Historical data caching strategy

3. **Execution Realism**
   - Slippage modeling (1-2 ticks)
   - Commission structure ($0.50-2.00 per side)
   - Fill probability based on volume

4. **Extended Backtesting**
   - 6-12 month historical analysis
   - Multiple symbols simultaneously
   - Walk-forward optimization

1. Walk-forward optimization on extended data
2. Parameter sensitivity analysis
3. Multi-symbol portfolio backtesting
4. Live paper trading preparation

### Medium-Term (Next Quarter)
1. Real-time data feed integration
2. Live paper trading implementation
3. Performance monitoring dashboard
4. Risk management enhancements

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### From Real Data Testing

1. **Market Conditions Matter**
   - Not all OR breakouts are equal
   - Choppy markets = more whipsaws
   - Trending markets = better follow-through

2. **Win Rate Expectations**
   - 36-45% is realistic for ORB strategies
   - R-multiple averaging > 1.5 more important than win rate
   - Need positive expectancy, not high win rate

3. **Risk Management Critical**
   - Every losing trade hit stop exactly (good!)
   - No "hope and hold" beyond stop
   - Winners hit targets as designed

4. **Data Quality Essential**
   - Continuous minute coverage crucial
   - Gaps in OR period invalidate setup
   - Real data shows realistic performance
