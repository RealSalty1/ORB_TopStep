## 🎯 Strategy Overview

### Core Concept
The **Opening Range Breakout (ORB)** strategy identifies the high and low of the market's opening period (the "opening range") and trades breakouts above/below this range with confluence from multiple factors.

### Strategy Philosophy
1. **Market Opening = Information Flow**: The first minutes of trading establish key support/resistance levels as institutional orders are executed
2. **Breakout = Directional Bias**: When price breaks and holds above/below the OR, it signals potential trend continuation
3. **Confluence = Quality Filter**: Multiple confirming factors increase probability of successful breakouts
4. **Adaptive = Market-Responsive**: Parameters adjust to current volatility and market conditions

---

## 📊 Complete Strategy Specification

### 1. Opening Range (OR) Construction

#### Adaptive OR Length
The OR length adjusts based on overnight volatility:

```python
# Calculate normalized volatility
lookback = 20 bars (20 minutes pre-market)
returns = log(close[i] / close[i-1])
norm_vol = std(returns) / typical_vol

# Determine OR length
if norm_vol < low_vol_threshold (0.35):
    or_length = min_minutes (10 minutes)
elif norm_vol > high_vol_threshold (0.85):
    or_length = max_minutes (20 minutes)
else:
    or_length = base_minutes (15 minutes)
```

**Instrument-Specific Settings:**
| Instrument | Base | Min | Max | Low Threshold | High Threshold |
|------------|------|-----|-----|---------------|----------------|
| ES | 15m | 10m | 20m | 0.35 | 0.85 |
| NQ | 15m | 10m | 20m | 0.35 | 0.85 |
| GC | 15m | 10m | 20m | 0.35 | 0.85 |
| 6E | 15m | 10m | 20m | 0.35 | 0.85 |

#### OR Validity Checks
The OR must pass quality filters:

```python
# Width validation (normalized by ATR)
or_width_norm = or_width / atr_14
min_width_norm = 0.18  # Not too narrow
max_width_norm = 8.0   # Not too wide (relaxed for volatility)

# Absolute width limits (instrument-specific)
ES: min_width = 2.0 points, max_width = 25.0 points
NQ: min_width = 8.0 points, max_width = 100.0 points
GC: min_width = 2.0 points, max_width = 15.0 points
6E: min_width = 0.0003 points, max_width = 0.0020 points
```

#### Goldilocks Volume Filter
OR volume must be "just right" - not too low (no interest) or too high (false moves):

```python
# Calculate volume metrics during OR
or_cum_volume = sum(volume during OR period)
typical_volume = median(volume over last 20 ORs)
volume_ratio = or_cum_volume / typical_volume

# Volume quality checks
cum_ratio_min = 0.50   # At least 50% of typical volume
cum_ratio_max = 5.0    # Not more than 5x typical (relaxed)
spike_threshold = 4.0x typical bar volume  # Allow large spikes

# Drive energy (momentum during OR)
drive_energy = sum(abs(close[i] - open[i]) * volume[i]) / or_cum_volume
min_drive_energy = 0.25  # Minimum momentum
```

**Status:** Currently relaxed to allow more ORs to pass (was too restrictive)

---

### 2. Breakout Detection

#### Adaptive Buffer
The breakout buffer adjusts to current volatility:

```python
# Base buffer (instrument-specific)
ES: base_buffer = 0.75 points
NQ: base_buffer = 2.0 points
GC: base_buffer = 1.0 points
6E: base_buffer = 0.0003 points

# Volatility adjustment
recent_volatility = std(1-minute returns, last 20 bars)
volatility_scalar = 0.25
buffer = base_buffer + (recent_volatility * volatility_scalar)

# Clamp to limits
min_buffer = base_buffer * 0.67
max_buffer = base_buffer * 2.67
final_buffer = clamp(buffer, min_buffer, max_buffer)
```

#### Breakout Trigger Levels
```python
# Long breakout
long_trigger = or_high + buffer

# Short breakout
short_trigger = or_low - buffer
```

#### Retest Logic (Body-Based)
Prevents false breakouts by requiring body commitment:

```python
# For LONG breakout
initial_break = bar_close > long_trigger  # Body above trigger
retest_confirmed = bar_close > long_trigger  # Still committed

# Wick-only breaks are rejected
if bar_high > trigger but bar_close < trigger:
    status = "wick_only"  # Wait for retest
```

---

### 3. Confluence Scoring System

Each potential breakout is scored across 5 factors (0.0 to 1.0 each):

#### Factor 1: Relative Volume (20% weight)
Measures momentum behind the breakout:

```python
# Calculate breakout bar volume vs recent average
lookback = 20 bars
avg_volume = mean(volume[-lookback:])
breakout_volume = current_bar_volume

# Score
if breakout_volume > avg_volume * 1.5:
    score = 1.0  # Strong volume
elif breakout_volume > avg_volume:
    score = 0.5 + (breakout_volume/avg_volume - 1.0)
else:
    score = max(0.0, breakout_volume/avg_volume)
```

#### Factor 2: Price Action Quality (15% weight)
Assesses the strength of the breakout candle:

```python
# Candle range and body
candle_range = high - low
body_size = abs(close - open)
body_ratio = body_size / candle_range if range > 0 else 0

# Wick analysis
upper_wick = high - max(open, close)
lower_wick = min(open, close) - low

# Score components
strength = min(1.0, body_ratio * 2.0)  # Strong body preferred
conviction = 1.0 - (max(upper_wick, lower_wick) / candle_range)

score = (strength * 0.6) + (conviction * 0.4)
```

#### Factor 3: VWAP Alignment (25% weight)
Volume-Weighted Average Price as trend filter:

```python
# Calculate VWAP from session start
cumulative_tpv = sum(typical_price * volume)
cumulative_volume = sum(volume)
vwap = cumulative_tpv / cumulative_volume

# Distance from VWAP
distance = (price - vwap) / atr_14

# Score
if direction == LONG:
    if price > vwap:
        score = min(1.0, distance * 2.0)  # Above VWAP = bullish
    else:
        score = max(0.0, 0.5 + distance * 2.0)  # Below = weak
elif direction == SHORT:
    if price < vwap:
        score = min(1.0, abs(distance) * 2.0)  # Below VWAP = bearish
    else:
        score = max(0.0, 0.5 - distance * 2.0)  # Above = weak
```

#### Factor 4: ADX Trend Strength (20% weight)
Average Directional Index filters for trending vs choppy markets:

```python
# Wilder's ADX calculation
period = 14
+DI = smoothed positive directional movement / ATR
-DI = smoothed negative directional movement / ATR
DX = abs(+DI - -DI) / (+DI + -DI) * 100
ADX = smoothed DX (Wilder's smoothing)

# Trend alignment
if direction == LONG and +DI > -DI:
    alignment = 1.0
elif direction == SHORT and -DI > +DI:
    alignment = 1.0
else:
    alignment = 0.5  # Counter-trend

# Score (prefers ADX 20-40, too high = exhaustion)
if ADX < 15:
    strength = ADX / 15  # Weak trend
elif ADX < 40:
    strength = 1.0  # Strong trend
else:
    strength = 1.0 - min(1.0, (ADX - 40) / 30)  # Exhaustion

score = strength * alignment
```

#### Factor 5: Profile Proxy (20% weight)
Volume distribution analysis (simplified Point of Control):

```python
# Build volume profile for recent session
price_levels = {}
for bar in recent_bars:
    price_bucket = round(bar.close / tick_size) * tick_size
    price_levels[price_bucket] += bar.volume

# Find Point of Control (highest volume level)
poc = max(price_levels, key=price_levels.get)

# Distance from POC
distance_from_poc = (price - poc) / atr_14

# Score (breakout from high volume area = good)
if direction == LONG:
    if price > poc:
        score = min(1.0, 0.5 + distance_from_poc * 0.5)
    else:
        score = 0.3  # Breaking up from below POC
elif direction == SHORT:
    if price < poc:
        score = min(1.0, 0.5 + abs(distance_from_poc) * 0.5)
    else:
        score = 0.3  # Breaking down from above POC
```

#### Final Confluence Score
```python
weights = {
    'relative_volume': 0.20,
    'price_action': 0.15,
    'vwap': 0.25,
    'adx': 0.20,
    'profile': 0.20
}

final_score = sum(factor_score * weight for factor, weight in weights.items())

# Threshold for entry
min_confluence_score = 0.50  # Must score at least 50/100
```

---

### 4. Position Sizing & Risk Management

#### Initial Stop Placement
```python
# For LONG trades
initial_stop = or_low - (buffer * 0.5)  # Below OR low with buffer

# For SHORT trades
initial_stop = or_high + (buffer * 0.5)  # Above OR high with buffer

# Stop size limits
risk_dollars = abs(entry_price - initial_stop) * contract_size
min_stop_points = instrument.min_points  # ES: 3.0, NQ: 12.0, GC: 4.0, 6E: 0.00060
max_stop_r = instrument.max_risk_r  # ES: 1.4R

# Adjust if too wide
if risk_dollars / account_risk_per_trade > max_stop_r:
    initial_stop = entry_price - (sign * max_stop_r * account_risk_per_trade / contract_size)
```

#### Position Size Calculation
```python
# Risk per trade
account_balance = 50000  # Topstep 50K account
risk_per_trade_pct = 0.01  # 1% risk = $500
risk_dollars = account_balance * risk_per_trade_pct

# Contract size
risk_per_point = {
    'ES': 12.50,  # $50 per contract per point (full)
    'MES': 1.25,  # $5 per contract per point (micro)
    'NQ': 20.00,
    'MNQ': 2.00,
    'GC': 100.00,
    'MGC': 10.00,
    '6E': 12500.00
}

# Position size
stop_distance_points = abs(entry_price - initial_stop)
position_size = risk_dollars / (stop_distance_points * risk_per_point)

# Round down to whole contracts
position_size = floor(position_size)

# Minimum 1 contract
position_size = max(1, position_size)
```

---

### 5. Trade Management (OPTIMIZED)

#### Breakeven Move
**OPTIMIZED PARAMETER**: Move to breakeven at **+0.4R**

```python
# Track current R
entry_price = 5800.00
initial_stop = 5795.00  # 5 points = 1.0R
current_price = 5802.00
initial_risk = 5.00 points

current_r = (current_price - entry_price) / initial_risk
# current_r = (5802 - 5800) / 5.00 = +0.4R

# Move stop to breakeven
if current_r >= 0.4 and not moved_to_breakeven:
    new_stop = entry_price  # Move to entry
    moved_to_breakeven = True
```

**Why 0.4R?** 
- Protects capital early
- Prevents losers that went +0.5R first (33 trades / 17.8% of losers in ES)
- Not too early (0.3R choked profits in Round 2)

#### Staged Profit Targets
**OPTIMIZED PARAMETERS** (ES, Round 1):

**Target 1: +1.0R (60% position exit)**
```python
# Exit 60% of position at +1.0R
if current_r >= 1.0 and t1_not_hit:
    exit_contracts = position_size * 0.60
    remaining_contracts = position_size * 0.40
    
    realized_pnl = exit_contracts * 1.0R * risk_per_trade
    # Example: If risk $500, realize $300 (60% of 1.0R)
```

**Why 1.0R?**
- Higher targets (1.2R-2.5R) **decreased** win rate significantly (59% → 49%)
- Only 28% of trades reach +1R, so must be achievable
- Balances profit-taking with letting winners run

**Why 60% off?**
- Takes majority of profit off table early
- Leaves meaningful position (40%) for runners
- Tested 30%, 40%, 50%, 60% - 60% was optimal

**Target 2: +3.0R (30% position exit)**
```python
# Exit 30% more at +3.0R
if current_r >= 3.0 and t2_not_hit:
    exit_contracts = position_size * 0.30
    remaining_contracts = position_size * 0.10  # Runner
    
    realized_pnl += exit_contracts * 3.0R * risk_per_trade
```

**Runner: +4.5R (final 10%)**
```python
# Trail final 10% for home runs
if current_r >= 4.5:
    exit_all()
    realized_pnl += remaining_contracts * 4.5R * risk_per_trade
```

#### Time Stop
**STATUS**: **DISABLED** (was killing 39% of trades prematurely)

```python
# Original logic (now disabled)
time_stop_enabled = False
if time_stop_enabled:
    if bars_held > 60 and current_r < 0.4:
        exit_all("TIME_STOP")
```

#### Trailing Stop (Structure-Based)
For runner position after T2:

```python
# Find recent swing lows (LONG) or highs (SHORT)
lookback = 10 bars
if direction == LONG:
    trail_stop = min(low[-lookback:])
else:
    trail_stop = max(high[-lookback:])

# Only move stop up (for LONG) or down (for SHORT)
trail_stop = max(trail_stop, current_stop)  # For LONG
```

---

### 6. Governance & Risk Rules

#### Per-Instrument Daily Limits
```python
max_trades_per_day = 2  # Per instrument
max_total_daily_trades = 10  # Across all instruments (not reached in backtest)

# Track per instrument
trades_today = {
    'ES': 0,
    'NQ': 0,
    'GC': 0,
    '6E': 0
}

# Before entry
if trades_today[instrument] >= 2:
    reject_trade("max_daily_trades_reached")
```

#### Correlation-Aware Sizing
ES and NQ are highly correlated (0.95+):

```python
# Check concurrent positions
if holding_ES and wants_NQ:
    # Reduce NQ position size by correlation factor
    nq_size = nq_size * (1 - 0.5)  # 50% reduction
    
# Or reject if already at max correlation exposure
max_correlation_exposure = 2.0R  # Max 2R across correlated pairs
current_correlation_exposure = es_risk + (nq_risk * 0.5)
if current_correlation_exposure + new_trade_risk > 2.0:
    reject_trade("correlation_limit")
```

#### Topstep 50K Rules (Prop Firm)
```python
# Account rules
starting_balance = 50000
profit_target = 3000  # $3K to pass
daily_loss_limit = 1000  # Can't lose more than $1K per day
trailing_drawdown_max = 2000  # Can't drawdown more than $2K from peak

# Daily loss check
if daily_pnl < -1000:
    halt_trading()
    
# Trailing drawdown (DISABLED for data collection)
peak_balance = max(peak_balance, current_balance)
current_dd = peak_balance - current_balance
if current_dd > 2000:
    halt_trading()  # Currently commented out
```

- P/L: **-$391**
- Win Rate: 47.7%
- Avg Winner: 0.62R
- Avg Loser: -1.13R
- R:R: 0.550:1

**Issues:** Low win rate, winners too small

---

### Round 1: Conservative Optimization (20 trials)
**Goal:** Improve expectancy by increasing win rate

**Parameter Ranges:**
- T1: 0.8R - 1.8R
- T1 Fraction: 40% - 60%
- T2: 2.0R - 3.5R
- Breakeven: 0.4R - 0.7R
- Max Stop: 1.2R - 1.8R

**Best Configuration:**
- T1: **1.0R** (60% off)
- T2: 3.0R
- Breakeven: **0.4R**
- Max Stop: **1.4R**

**Results:**
- Expectancy: **-0.219R** ✅ **+25.8% improvement!**
- P/L: **-$291**
- Win Rate: **58.2%** ✅ **+10.5%!**
- Avg Winner: 0.50R (down from 0.62R)
- Avg Loser: -1.27R (worse)
- R:R: 0.393:1

**Key Finding:** Lower T1 target (1.0R vs 0.6R) increased win rate significantly, offsetting smaller winners

---

### Round 2: Aggressive Optimization (25 trials)
**Goal:** Push to profitability by letting winners run further

**Parameter Ranges (AGGRESSIVE):**
- T1: **1.2R - 2.5R** (much higher!)
- T1 Fraction: **30% - 50%** (take less off)
- T2: 3.0R - 4.0R
- Breakeven: **0.5R - 0.8R** (later)
- Max Stop: 1.2R - 1.6R

**Best Configuration:**
- T1: 1.2R (50% off)
- T2: 4.0R
- Breakeven: 0.5R
- Max Stop: 1.2R

**Results:**
- Expectancy: **-0.269R** ❌ **Worse than Round 1!**
- P/L: **-$357**
- Win Rate: **54.0%** (dropped 4.2%)
- Avg Winner: 0.53R (barely improved)
- Avg Loser: -1.20R
- R:R: 0.439:1

**Critical Finding:** Higher targets (1.2R+) **HURT** performance!
- Win rate dropped from 59% → 54%
- Winners only improved by +0.03R
- More losers offset the small gain in winner size
- **Lesson:** Sweet spot is around T1 = 1.0R for ES

---

### Round 3: Multi-Asset Portfolio Test
**Configuration:** ES + NQ + 6E

**Per-Instrument Results:**
| Instrument | Trades | P/L | Win Rate | Expectancy |
|------------|--------|-----|----------|------------|
| ES | 354 | -$290 | 58.2% | -0.218R |
| NQ | 372 | -$486 | 49.2% | -0.218R |
| 6E | 308 | $0 | 48.1% | -0.476R |

**Portfolio Result:**
- Total Trades: 1,034
- P/L: **-$776** ❌ **$485 worse than ES alone!**
- Win Rate: 51.9%
- Expectancy: -0.295R

**Finding:** Diversification **hurts** because NQ and 6E drag down ES performance. ES alone is the best option.

## 🔍 Key Insights & Learnings

### What Works ✅
1. **Entry Logic is Excellent**
   - 58.2% win rate proves direction-picking works
   - Confluence scoring effectively filters quality setups
   - Adaptive OR responds well to volatility

2. **Breakeven Protection Works**
   - Moving to BE at +0.4R prevents 17.8% of losers
   - Reduces emotional stress (can't lose after +0.4R)
   - Not too early (0.3R choked profits)

3. **Risk Management is Solid**
   - Stop placement is consistent
   - Position sizing follows 1% rule
   - Never risking more than 1.4R

4. **Per-Instrument Limits Work**
   - 2 trades/day prevents overtrading
   - Forces selectivity
   - Reduces revenge trading risk

### What Doesn't Work ❌
1. **R:R Ratio is Too Low**
   - 0.393:1 means winners are less than half of losers
   - With 58% win rate, need at least 0.7:1 for breakeven
   - Core issue: Taking profits too early

2. **Partial Exits May Be Flawed**
   - Taking 60% off at 1.0R limits upside
   - Only 28% of trades reach +1R
   - Those that do often have more to give

3. **Winners Exit Too Soon**
   - Avg winner 0.50R vs avg loser 1.27R
   - Target 1 at 1.0R may still be too close
   - Most trades don't reach T2 (3.0R) or Runner (4.5R)

4. **Higher Targets Hurt Win Rate**
   - Tested T1 at 1.2R-2.5R in Round 2
   - Win rate dropped from 59% → 54%
   - Small gain in winner size was offset by more losers
   - Lesson: Can't push winners much further without sacrificing win rate

5. **Multi-Asset Doesn't Help**
   - NQ and 6E perform worse than ES
   - Diversification adds losing trades
   - ES alone is the best choice

---

## 🎯 Strategic Assessment

### The Core Problem
**"Good entry, poor exit"** - The strategy correctly identifies 58% of moves but gives back profits:
- Taking 60% off at +1.0R banks profit fast
- But leaves no room for the 10-20R moves that would make the strategy highly profitable
- Losers average -1.27R but winners only capture 0.50R

### Why Optimization Hit a Wall
After 45+ trials testing T1 from 0.6R to 2.5R:
- **Lower targets (0.6R-1.0R)**: Higher win rate but smaller winners
- **Higher targets (1.2R-2.5R)**: Bigger winners but much lower win rate
- **Sweet spot (1.0R)**: Best balance, but still slightly losing

**Conclusion:** The partial exit approach has a fundamental ceiling. Can't optimize our way to profitability without rethinking exits.

## 💡 Recommendations

### Option 1: Paper Trade Current Setup (RECOMMENDED)
**Why:** Only -$29/month is essentially breakeven in backtests

**Action Plan:**
1. Start with ES micro contracts (MES = $1.25/point vs $12.50)
2. Paper trade for 2-3 weeks
3. Track execution quality (slippage, fills, emotional control)
4. See if live behavior matches backtest
5. Decide based on live results

**Pros:**
- Low risk (MES is tiny)
- Real-world validation
- Build trading experience
- Only cost is time

**Cons:**
- Will likely still lose small amounts
- May be frustrating to trade breakeven strategy
- No guarantee live matches backtest

---

### Option 2: Fundamental Redesign
**Why:** Partial exits may be the problem

**Ideas to Test:**
1. **All-or-Nothing Exits**
   - No partials, just entry → full exit
   - Use pure trailing stops
   - May capture big moves better

2. **Trailing Stops Only**
   - No fixed targets
   - Trail based on ATR or structure
   - Let market tell you when done

3. **Quality Over Quantity**
   - Raise confluence threshold from 0.50 → 0.70
   - Trade less, win more
   - Accept lower trade frequency

4. **Time-of-Day Filters**
   - Only trade first hour (9:30-10:30 ET)
   - Avoid chop in afternoon
   - May improve win quality

**Pros:**
- Potential to break through profitability ceiling
- Learn more about market behavior
- Could lead to breakthrough

**Cons:**
- Requires 1-2 weeks of work
- No guarantee of improvement
- May end up back where we started

---

### Option 3: Accept Reality & Move On
**Why:** Some strategies just don't work

**Action:**
- Accept that ES ORB with this ruleset isn't viable
- Study why it failed (exits, R:R mismatch)
- Apply learnings to next strategy
- Try different approach (mean reversion, momentum, etc.)

**Pros:**
- Don't waste time on losing strategy
- Move to potentially better ideas
- Valuable learning experience

**Cons:**
- All work feels "wasted"
- No trading system in place
- Back to square one

## 🔄 Data Quality Notes

### Critical Bug Fixed (October 7, 2025)
**Issue:** Calendar spread contracts (e.g., "ESZ24-ESH25") were included in continuous contract construction, introducing negative prices (-10, +5, etc.) that corrupted all data.

**Impact:** Initial backtest showed -$241,000 loss (catastrophic)

**Fix:** Filter out any contract symbol containing '-' before building continuous contract

**Result:** After fix, backtest improved to -$291 (near breakeven!)

**Code:**
```python
# In scripts/convert_databento_to_json.py
df = df[~df['contract'].str.contains('-', na=False)].copy()
```

This was a **critical discovery** - always validate raw data quality!

---

## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

1. **Data Quality is Critical**
   - One bad data point can corrupt everything
   - Always validate continuous contract construction
   - Check for negative prices, gaps, outliers

2. **Optimization Has Limits**
   - Can't optimize away fundamental strategy flaws
   - 45+ trials all converged to same range (-0.22R to -0.30R)
   - Sweet spot exists but may not be profitable

3. **Win Rate vs R:R Trade-off is Real**
   - Higher targets = lower win rate (tested empirically)
   - Lower targets = higher win rate but smaller winners
   - Can't have both (at least with this approach)

4. **Diversification Isn't Always Better**
   - ES alone outperformed ES+NQ+6E portfolio
   - Bad instruments drag down good ones
   - Focus on best performer

5. **Near-Breakeven Has Value**
   - Strategy shows it can consistently execute
   - Direction-picking is strong (58% win rate)
   - Execution logic is sound
   - Just needs better exit management
