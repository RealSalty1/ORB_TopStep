# High-Resolution ES Data Analysis

**Analysis Date:** October 8, 2025  
**Data Period:** September 8, 2025 - October 7, 2025 (30 days)

## Executive Summary

Two high-resolution datasets from Databento have been added for ES futures:
1. **Tick-by-tick trade data** - Every individual trade executed
2. **1-second OHLCV bars** - Aggregated second-by-second price data

This represents a significant upgrade from the existing 1-minute data, enabling microsecond-precision strategy development and microstructure analysis.

## Technical Considerations

### Data Processing

**Compressed Size vs. Uncompressed:**
- Trade data: 167 MB → ~2.5 GB uncompressed
- 1s OHLCV: 9.9 MB → ~150 MB uncompressed

**Processing Speed:**
- 1 day of trades: ~300k rows, processes in ~2-5 seconds
- 1 day of 1s bars: ~40k rows, processes in <1 second
- Full month: ~10 million trades, processes in ~60-120 seconds

**Storage Requirements:**
- Current month (compressed): 177 MB
- Projected year (compressed): ~2.1 GB
- 5 years (compressed): ~10.5 GB
- **Very manageable!**

### Integration with Existing System

**Current System:**
- `DatabentoLoader` loads 1m bars from JSON
- `orb_confluence/backtest/orb_2_engine.py` processes bar-by-bar
- Strategy operates on 15m ORB with 1m execution

**Modification Path:**
1. Create `HighResDataLoader` for 1s/trade data
2. Extend event loop to handle sub-minute ticks
3. Add microstructure feature calculators
4. Implement order flow analytics module
5. Create high-frequency strategy variants

## Performance Considerations

### Latency Budget for Live Trading

| Component | Latency | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Exchange → Databento** | 100-500μs | Fiber connection |
| **Databento → Client** | 1-10ms | Internet + processing |
| **Data parsing** | 0.1-0.5ms | Python/Cython |
| **Feature calculation** | 0.5-2ms | Vectorized ops |
| **Signal generation** | 0.1-0.5ms | Logic evaluation |
| **Order submission** | 5-20ms | API + routing |

|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 1 day trades | ~200 MB | Chunked streaming |
| 1 day 1s bars | ~15 MB | Load in memory |
